# top10_movies

This app displays a list of the 10 most watched movies in the USA, using data fetched from a public API.

## To test the app you must:

- Enable developer options and debugging on your phone
- Clone this project
- Open it on your Android Studio
- Just run the code and you're good to go

## Features:

- Search bar to find your favorite movie on the list
- Filter dialog to select one or more options and filter the data by genre

## Important:
You can test it with the emulator, but I've test it on my Moto G14 on both vertical and horizontal screens, works just fine.
